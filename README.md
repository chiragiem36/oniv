asset creation ( test result )


The whole repo is currently in production and deployed on the server. So uploading whole repo doesnt sound safe to me. Hence I am uploading the part of repo that will make the things more clear

"checkAnswers" function is where an immutable asset is created and stored on bigchain db, which is Blockchain as a service.
Bigchain db stores this asset on db. This asset is immutable

here is link to bigchain db logs - https://docs.bigchaindb.com/en/latest/index.html#

Bigchain db is set to release its final version in April End.
Notice - Even ethereum and many prominent blockchain like Credits and NEO are still is still in developments

Bigchain like any block chain is also decentralized and runs on many nodes to provide safety to data from various attacks or data mutation. More the number of chains more will be the security

Many such bigchain masternodes can be spin up by community to provide more safety to assets
